         Truthfully, we are all forgetful Fred sometimes. Forgetful fred is a mix of traits, namely
         that he tends to forget to charge his phone at night and leaves his spare charger with friends.
         He uses the charging station when his phone is out of battery and he has no way other way of contacting
         others. He tends to come to the charging station not by choice, but out of necessity. He will stay to use the charging 
         station until his phone charges and leave, unlike other users who will stay in the SciLi and study while using the interface.

            Studious Sally is as put together as we wish we could all be. She uses the charging station to 
            help her buckle down and grind during her SciLi study sessions, not because her phone is necessarily
            out of battery. Sometimes, she gets nervous that she's going to miss important messages because her phone 
            is out of reach, but she knows that she'll be able to reach out to people when she periodically checks her phone
            out of the charging station just to keep updated.
