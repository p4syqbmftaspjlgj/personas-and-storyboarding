        <h2>OBSERVATIONS & INTERVIEWS</h2>
      <div class="empathy-box">
        People spent max 1-2 minutes at the station, and the time spent lingering was usually on the “retreive phone” page where it asks the user to input their pin to unlock the box with their phone
        <p></p>
        When people chose a box for their phone, they almost always chose the first available box highest from the ground. In other words, the red boxes were clustered at the top while the blue, available boxes were toward the bottom
        <p></p>
        Within an hour-long window, most few people did not retrieve their phone, indicating people spent a long time with their phones away and charged
